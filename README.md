# Mass_Email_Sender
## Overview
This is a web application that allows you to send emails to multiple recipients at once. It reads the recipient email addresses from a CSV file and sends an email to each one. The application supports multiple email providers.

## languages and Framework Used 
 FRONTEND
 - Html
 - Css
 - JS
 - Tailwind
   
 BACKEND
 - Python
 - Django

## Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- A CSV file with a column named 'email' containing the email addresses of the recipients

## Libraries Used
- csv
- smtplib
- email.mime.multipart
- email.mime.text

## How to Use
1. Open the web application in your browser.
2. Fill in the form fields with your email address, password, subject, and text.
3. Upload your CSV file.
4. Click the "Submit" button to send the emails.

## Functionality
The web application uses a Python script on the backend to send the emails. When you submit the form, the script logs into the SMTP server with the provided email address and password. It then reads the CSV file and extracts the email addresses. For each email address, it creates a new email with the provided subject and text, and sends it using the SMTP server.

The script automatically selects the SMTP server and port based on the email domain. It currently supports Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, AOL, Hotmail, and ProtonMail. You can easily add more email providers by updating the `email_providers` dictionary in the script.

## Error handeling
1.Unfilled Fields: The application checks if all the required fields in the form are filled. If a field is left empty and the user attempts to submit the form, an error message is displayed below the corresponding field, and the page automatically scrolls to that field. The error message is removed as soon as the user starts typing in the field.

2.Incorrect Email or Password: After ensuring all fields are filled, the application sends a request to the server to authenticate the userâ€™s email and password. If the server responds with a status indicating that the email or password is incorrect, an error message is displayed under both the email and password fields. The user can then correct their email or password and try again.

## Note
Different email providers may have different security settings. For example, to use Gmail's SMTP server, you may need to enable "Less secure app access" in your Google account settings.
